757930,What is ottoman empire?,"Ottoman Empire also Turkish Empire\n\nA vast Turkish sultanate of southwest Asia, northeast Africa, and southeast Europe. It was founded in the 13th century by Osman I and ruled by his descendants until its dissolution after World War I. Originally a small state controlled by Ottoman or Osmanli Turks, it spread rapidly, superseding the Byzantine Empire in the east.\n\n\nOttoman Empire (ŏt'əmən) , vast state founded in the late 13th cent. by Turkish tribes in Anatolia and ruled by the descendants of Osman I until its dissolution in 1918. Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms “Turkey” and “Ottoman Empire” were often used interchangeably.\nOrganization of the Empire\n\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\n\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\n\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the Köprülü family). The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\n\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. The pashas and hospodars (governors) who administered the provinces and vassal states purchased their posts at exorbitant prices. They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\n\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. This, however, did not prevent occasional massacres and discriminatory fiscal practices. In Constantinople the Greeks and Armenians held a privileged status and were very influential in commerce and politics. The despotic system of government was mitigated only by the observance of Muslim law.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Ottoman state began as one of many small Turkish states that emerged in Asia Minor during the breakdown of the empire of the Seljuk Turks. The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451–81) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. The Ottoman siege of Constantinople was lifted at the appearance of Timur, who defeated and captured Beyazid in 1402. The Ottomans, however, soon rallied.\n\nThe Period of Great Expansion\n\nThe empire, reunited by Muhammad I, expanded victoriously under Muhammad's successors Murad II and Muhammad II. The victory (1444) at Var","Dummy reply to: Pregunta: What is ottoman empire?

747429,what is a transistor laser?,"A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a ""pure"" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned.  This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once.  Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance.  That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells).","Dummy reply to: Pregunta: what is a transistor laser?

757930,What is ottoman empire?,"Ottoman Empire also Turkish Empire\n\nA vast Turkish sultanate of southwest Asia, northeast Africa, and southeast Europe. It was founded in the 13th century by Osman I and ruled by his descendants until its dissolution after World War I. Originally a small state controlled by Ottoman or Osmanli Turks, it spread rapidly, superseding the Byzantine Empire in the east.\n\n\nOttoman Empire (ŏt'əmən) , vast state founded in the late 13th cent. by Turkish tribes in Anatolia and ruled by the descendants of Osman I until its dissolution in 1918. Modern Turkey formed only part of the empire, but the terms “Turkey” and “Ottoman Empire” were often used interchangeably.\nOrganization of the Empire\n\nEconomically, socially, and militarily, Turkey was a medieval state, unaffected by the developments in the rest of Europe. Turkish domination over the northern part of Africa (except Tripoli and Egypt) was never well defined or effective, and the eastern border was inconstant, shifting according to frequent wars with Persia. Of the vassal princes, only the khans of Crimea were generally loyal.\n\nThe sultans themselves had sunk into indolence and depravity. Until the ascension (1603) of Ahmad I, the succession to the throne was habitually contested by all the sons of the deceased sultan, and it was the patriotic duty of the victor to kill his rivals in order to restore order. Although this practice was barbarous, when it ceased other problems arose. The eldest male member of the family was recognized as the heir-designate, but to prevent threats to the sultan the imperial prince was denied any involvement in public affairs and was kept in luxurious imprisonment. When the prince finally ascended the throne, he was often alcoholic or lunatic.\n\nActual rule was usually exercised by the grand viziers, many of whom were able men (notably those of the Köprülü family). The sultans themselves often were the creatures of the Janissaries, whose favor was purchased by large gifts at the ascension of a sultan.\n\nOne of the most nefarious aspects of the court of Constantinople (known as the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte) was the all-pervading corruption and bribery that had been raised to a system of administration. The pashas and hospodars (governors) who administered the provinces and vassal states purchased their posts at exorbitant prices. They recovered their fortunes by extorting still larger sums from their subjects. The peasantry was thus reduced to abject misery.\n\nA positive feature in Ottoman administration was the religious toleration generally extended to all non-Muslims. This, however, did not prevent occasional massacres and discriminatory fiscal practices. In Constantinople the Greeks and Armenians held a privileged status and were very influential in commerce and politics. The despotic system of government was mitigated only by the observance of Muslim law.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Ottoman state began as one of many small Turkish states that emerged in Asia Minor during the breakdown of the empire of the Seljuk Turks. The Ottoman Turks began to absorb the other states, and during the reign (1451–81) of Muhammad II they ended all other local Turkish dynasties. The early phase of Ottoman expansion took place under Osman I, Orkhan, Murad I, and Beyazid I at the expense of the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, and Serbia. Bursa fell in 1326 and Adrianople (the modern Edirne) in 1361; each in turn became the capital of the empire. The great Ottoman victories of Kosovo (1389) and Nikopol (1396) placed large parts of the Balkan Peninsula under Ottoman rule and awakened Europe to the Ottoman danger. The Ottoman siege of Constantinople was lifted at the appearance of Timur, who defeated and captured Beyazid in 1402. The Ottomans, however, soon rallied.\n\nThe Period of Great Expansion\n\nThe empire, reunited by Muhammad I, expanded victoriously under Muhammad's successors Murad II and Muhammad II.

239851,Who is Earth-2 Superman and how is he different from regular Superman? Why are there two Supermen and why is one older than the other?,"It's relatively simple.  Back in 1961, DC Comics revealed that all of their Golden Age (c. 1939-1945) characters had lived on a different Earth from their Silver Age (c. 1956-1970) characters.  Some characters (Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman) were virtually the same on each Earth, while others (The Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom) were radically different.  \nEarth 2's Superman was slightly less powerful than Earth 1's, mostly adhering to the classic ""Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound"" description.  Earth 1's Superman could travel faster than light, juggle planets, and had a host of super powers including super-breath, super-ventriloquism, and super-hypnotism.  Earth 2's Superman eventually married Lois Lane and became the editor of the Daily Star before (temporarily) disappearing in 1985's ""Crisis on Infinite Earths.""  Earth 1's Superman finished his adventures in Alan Moore's ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?,"" a two-parter than wrapped up and resolved some 30 years of continuity.  Both Supermen were supplanted by John Byrne's 1985 reboot of the character, which was intended to simplify that continuity and start over from scratch.\nEarth 2's Superman has reappeared twice since ""Crisis;"" once in 1999's ""Kingdom Come,"" and most recently in 2005's ""Infinite Crisis.""  What his role is in this maxiseries is undetermined as of this writing.  Earth 1's Superman has yet to reappear, but longtime fans can always hope.","Earth-2 Superman es una versión alternativa de Superman que proviene de una Tierra paralela en el multiverso de DC Comics. Las principales diferencias son:

*   **Orígenes:** Aunque ambos provienen de Krypton, Earth-2 Superman es mayor, habiendo llegado a la Tierra antes que el Superman de Tierra-1 (el Superman ""regular"").
*   **Edad y Historia:** Earth-2 Superman es un hombre de mediana edad, casado con Lois Lane (también de Tierra-2) y tiene un hijo llamado Val-Zod.  Ha luchado en la Segunda Guerra Mundial.
*   **Moral y Métodos:** Aunque también es un héroe, Earth-2 Superman suele ser representado como más tradicional y conservador en sus métodos que el Superman más moderno.

**¿Por qué dos Supermen?** La existencia de Earth-2 Superman y otros personajes duplicados se debe al concepto del multiverso, introducido en DC Comics para explicar incongruencias y revivir personajes de la Edad de Oro. Permitió historias alternativas y exploraciones de ""qué pasaría si"".

**¿Por qué uno más viejo?** Earth-2 Superman es más viejo porque representa la continuidad de la Edad de Oro de los cómics, mientras que el Superman ""regular"" representa la continuidad de la Edad de Plata/Bronce/Moderna.

Can't find that reference any more.","Direct quote from http://www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm: ""To be somewhere with ""bells on"" refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares. To avoid Indians, they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area. Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins. Hence, ""I'll be there with bells on."" The peddlers' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers, not only for the goods they sold, but also for the news, letters, and messages they carried from the outside world.""","The origin of ""I'll be there with bells on"" is likely related to the festive use of bells, particularly during holidays and celebrations like Christmas and weddings. It's meant to convey enthusiastic willingness and eagerness to attend.

Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market.

Others might say that freemasons are inherently religious people with connections to their status in the society directly coorelating with their positions in their church of choice.  Still there are some people that claim further study into organized religions and freemasonry will show their origins are directly linked together, and that their purposes are twofold in so-called ""faith"" and the controlling of culture through that so-called ""faith""...thereby falling into suspicion of ""satanic"" influences.  It is true that freemason rites and rituals are very similar to that of witchcraft, satanic followings, and even some lesser known culture followings such as hermetics...all of which have had their purposes challenged as satanic from the general, unknowing public.\n\nThe truth is that you will never know the answer to your question by asking it here, and you cannot confirm any answer you might recieve without experiencing the masonic rites yourself.  Furthermore, any member of a masonic society will claim no knowledge of satanic connections to their brotherhood.  The secrets of these societies are replete with whispers of foul play and undertones of godless or godlike actions and/or beliefs.  \n\nYour answer lies in your question.

801362,what is best affiliate site and best email advertisment paying site.? i wish to earn through my site so want to be an affiliate. My site is on indian stocks. Also I have a big email list which is quite genuine so I can also promote some advertisements on email.,Try http://www.clickbank.com and http://www.cj.com .\n\nBoth are leaders in providing affiliate solution.,"Okay, here's a breakdown of affiliate and email advertising options for your Indian stock market website, focused on maximizing earnings:

**Best Affiliate Site Options (Indian Stocks Focus):**

*   **Zerodha Affiliate Program:**  A popular discount broker in India, offering commissions on account openings and trades.  Good fit for your audience.  (High potential earnings).
*   **Upstox Partner Program:**  Similar to Zerodha, Upstox is another leading discount broker.  Compare commission structures and suitability. (High potential earnings).
*   **Angel One Affiliate Program:** Another big broker which could provide a suitable fit.
*   **Motilal Oswal Affiliate Program:**  A well-established brokerage with a broader range of financial products. Might appeal to a wider segment of your audience. (Medium to High potential earnings).
*   **Financial Education Platforms (e.g., Elearnmarkets, Nifty Trading Academy):** Promote courses and workshops related to stock market investing and trading.  Generates value for your audience and earns commissions. (Medium potential earnings).
*   **Financial News/Data Providers (e.g., Tijori Finance, Trendlyne):**  If your audience needs in-depth data, consider affiliate partnerships with these services. (Medium potential earnings, niche audience).

**Best Email Advertising Paying Site Options:**

*   **Google AdSense for Email:** This allows Google to place targeted ads within your emails. Requires a large, active list and adherence to Google's policies. (Variable earnings, depends on engagement).
*   **Direct Ad Sales:** The most lucrative, but requires more effort.  Sell ad slots directly to relevant companies (e.g., brokers, financial news sites, fintech startups). Negotiate rates and terms. (Highest potential earnings, but more work).
*   **Email Advertising Networks:** There are networks that connect email list owners with advertisers. Look for ones that focus on the finance/investment niche. (Examples:  Although not specifically for finance, explore email ad networks and filter for relevant opportunities). (Medium potential earnings).
*   **Sponsored Content/Dedicated Emails:** Charge companies a fee to send an entire email dedicated to their product or service to your list. (High potential earnings, but requires careful vetting of advertisers).

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Relevance:** Always choose affiliate programs and advertisers that are genuinely relevant to your audience and their interests in the Indian stock market.
*   **Trust:** Promote products/services you believe in.  Preserve the trust of your email list.
*   **Transparency:** Disclose your affiliate relationships and sponsored content clearly.
*   **Compliance:**  Adhere to all relevant regulations regarding email marketing and advertising.
*   **Terms and Conditions:** Carefully review the terms and conditions of any affiliate program or advertising agreement.
*   **Testing:** Experiment with different offers and ad formats to see what performs best with your audience.

**Recommendation for Starting:**

1.  **Focus on Brokerage Affiliates:**  Start with Zerodha, Upstox, and Angel One due to their high commission potential and relevance to your audience.
2.  **Explore Direct Ad Sales:** Begin reaching out to relevant companies for potential direct ad deals.
3.  **Gradually Add Other Options:** Expand into financial education and data provider affiliates, and consider AdSense or email ad networks as your list grows further.

647842,How can I get a static IP adddress when my ISP assigns me a dynamic address? So I can host my own web site.?,"A way around a Static IP is using a Dynamic DNS provider like No-IP.  You install a small program on your pc that updates your ip address each time it changes.  Then you can access your ip using Dynamic DNS.  I think some of the providers may offer using your own domain, but you may be interested in checking out low cost hosting providers.","You have a few options:

1. **Pay your ISP for a static IP:** Many ISPs offer static IP addresses as a premium service. This is the easiest but most expensive option.

2. **Use a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service:** DDNS services track your changing IP address and associate it with a fixed domain name.  When your IP changes, the DDNS service updates the record. This allows users to access your website using the domain name even though the IP address is dynamic.  Services like No-IP or DynDNS offer this.

3. **Use a reverse proxy/tunneling service:** Services like Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or localtunnel can create a secure tunnel from your server to their network, allowing you to expose your website without directly exposing your IP address. They handle the IP address updates for you.

Choosing the best option depends on your budget and technical expertise. DDNS is often the most affordable, while paying for a static IP is the most straightforward.  Reverse proxy services offer security and ease of use, but might have limitations on usage.",0.7904139757156372,1762820083652,flink

I used online dating on and off for about a year before I met him.  \n\nOnline dating is just another way to meet people, but it shouldn't be the only way you meet people.  If you're banking on it working, it probably won't because you've invested too much emotionally and your expectations will colour your experience.  It works when you stop hoping each person you meet will be the one and instead, decide to just have fun with the experience, regardless of the outcome.  Yes, even a bad date can be fun.  Think of the anecdotes you can share with your friends.\n\nI find it takes a few weeks to get a feel for how things work.  Then, it's up and down for awhile depending on who you come into contact with.  When it doesn't feel fun anymore, TAKE A BREAK.  Come back in a few months.  Change your profile to reflect how you're feeling.  \n\nIt's important that you feel good about yourself or you won't attract the people you want because who wants to be with someone who's down on themselves?  Online dating is really a reflection of how you're  feeling.  When you feel good about yourself, your online experience improves.  When you feel bad, it tends to be a not so good experience.  \n\nI was about to pull my dating profile because I found I was meeting lots of people through offline methods.  However, my friend pointed out that it wasn't costing me anything (financially or emotionally) if I just left my profile up.  \n\nI thought she made a good point, so I decided to rewrite my profile one last time and put it out there.  When I rewrote it this time, I stopped caring about what other people would think about what I wrote or how they might judge me.  Instead, I wrote a profile that reflected exactly how I felt and who I was at that moment.\n\nAnd then, I started to meet interesting people.

*   **If the 401k has roth funds:** You could roll over to a Roth IRA, and then withdrawal contributions, as that would avoid the penalty.

Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.\n\n- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year.  Playing a game takes a lot of the players time preparing and practicing.  Also due the physical nature of the game, players need several days to recovery.

It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or ""snoop"" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or ""inject"" unwelcome traffic as well. However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\n\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\n\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\n\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now ""secure enough"" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or ""encrypt"" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!","Dummy reply to: Pregunta: Are Wireless Networks Secure?

There is no absolutely definitive evidence to date.

Desire comes from an interest that can grow into passion.\n\nIf you have a passion for something, you'll do whatever it takes to be successful.

It is what drives them to succeed and motivates them to give 100%. Without it, they would just be average.\n\nTo be successful in the pursuit of fitness, it needs to become a passion. So if you don't have a strong interest in becoming fit, I suggest you find other activities you do enjoy. Getting fit isn't something anybody does well as a passing interest.\n\nBut do realize that you need to know more about fitness in general before you can develop a real enthusiasm for it. In my case, as I kept learning more and more about training, nutrition and supplements, my interest really started to grow.\n\nAnd understand that you don't need to be obsessive about working out.

951733,Who is nicolaus copernicus?,"""Mikołaj Kopernik (February 19, 1473–May 24, 1543), more commonly known by the Latin form Nicolaus Copernicus, was a Polish astronomer, mathematician and economist, mainly remembered for developing a scientifically useful heliocentric (Sun-centered) theory of the solar system. His main occupations and services rendered were in Royal Prussia, as church canon, governor and administrator, economist, jurist, physician, astrologer and military leader (conducting defense against the Teutonic Order). Amid all his responsibilities, he treated astronomy as a hobby. His theory about the Sun as the center of the Universe, opposed to the traditional geocentric theory that placed Earth at the center, is considered one of the most important discoveries ever, and is the fundamental starting point of modern astronomy and modern science itself (it inaugurated a scientific revolution). His theory affected many aspects of human life, opening the door for young astronomers, scientists and scholars to take a skeptical attitude toward established dogma.""","Dummy reply to: Pregunta: Who is nicolaus copernicus?

Use the command ""ps ax"" to try to determine what processes are running that might have something to do with your ethernet interface.\n\nDHCPCD is a popular one.  Look to /etc/dhcpc for any files that might be there.\n\nPUMP is also a frequent program in use by some versions of RedHat Linux.

653054,Are Wireless Networks Secure?,"Unfortunately, no computer network is truly secure. It's always theoretically possible for eavesdroppers to view or ""snoop"" the traffic on any network, and it's often possible to add or ""inject"" unwelcome traffic as well. However, some networks are built and managed much more securely than others. For both wired and wireless networks alike, the real question to answer becomes - is it secure enough?\n\nWireless networks add an extra level of security complexity compared to wired networks. Whereas wired networks send electrical signals or pulses of light through cable, wireless radio signals propogate through the air and are naturally easier to intercept. Signals from most wireless LANs (WLANs) pass through exterior walls and into nearby streets or parking lots.\n\nNetwork engineers and other technology experts have closely scrutinized wireless network security because of the open-air nature of wireless communications. The practice of wardriving, for example, exposed the vulnerabilities of home WLANs and accelerated the pace of security technology advances in home wireless equipment.\n\nOverall, conventional wisdom holds that wireless networks are now ""secure enough"" to use in the vast majority of homes, and  many businesses. Security features like 128-bit WEP and WPA can scramble or ""encrypt"" network traffic so that its contents can not easily be deciphered by snoopers. Likewise, wireless routers and access points (APs) incorporate access control features such as MAC address filtering that deny network requests from unwanted clients.\n\nObviously every home or business must determine for themselves the level of risk they are comfortable in taking when implementing a wireless network. The better a wireless network is administered, the more secure it becomes. However, the only truly secure network is the one never built!","Dummy reply to: Pregunta: Are Wireless Networks Secure?

When its rotors are spinning, a helicopter doesn't look much like an airplane. But the rotor blades have an airfoil shape like the wings of an airplane.
